### üßπ Data Cleaning & Transformation Steps:
- Removed duplicate records and handled missing values to ensure data integrity.
- Standardized categorical fields (e.g., job roles, education fields) for consistency.
- Created calculated columns such as **SalarySlab** to simplify analysis.
- Joined additional tables to enrich the dataset with department and tenure information.
- Applied transformations (e.g., date formats, string trimming) for cleaner visuals.
- Created relationships between tables to ensure correct filtering and aggregation.

These steps ensured the data was clean, reliable, and ready for meaningful visualization.
